At some point in the future, more work will likely be done to build custom views for the following configurations but for now we just leverage Django's out of the box admin.\r\n\r\n### Add Jenkins Site\r\n\r\n1. In the Django admin for your app (http://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/admin), click the Add link for 'Jenkins Site'.\r\n2. Enter a slug (becomes part of the url path for the site in the app), site url, and username/password.  If you are using the Github Authentication Plug In to handle Jenkins security as the [CumulusCI](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/CumulusCI/blob/master/docs/setup/README.md) setup documentation details, you need to go to your account in Jenkins and get your API token to use as the password.\r\n3. Go to http://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/mrbelvedere/jenkins/YOUR_SLUG/update_jobs\r\n4. Go back to the Django admin (http://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/admin)\r\n5. Click on Jobs and you should see all your Jenkins jobs listed\r\n\r\n### Create GitHub Webhook\r\n\r\n1. Go to your repositories and click the **Settings** link.\r\n2. Go to **Service Hooks**\r\n3. Add a new entry under **WebHook URLs** to point to http://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/mrbelvedere/github/webhook/\r\n4. Do a commit against your repository\r\n5. Check the **Pushs** section of the Django admin.  You should see the commit appear here.  Sometimes the webhook takes a few minutes to come through for the first time.\r\n\r\n### Creating triggers\r\n\r\nThe mrbelvedere application is used by the [CumulusCI](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/CumulusCI) to trigger Jenkins jobs with logic not possible through the available Jenkins plugin community.\r\n\r\nWhen mrbelvedere receives a GitHub post-commit webhook, it creates a Pull in the database.  The Pull is linked to a Repository, GithubUser, and Branch, all of which are created automatically if they did not previously exist.  These objects create a reference point to easily bind in custom trigger logic.\r\n\r\nThe triggers pass the branch name of the commit `branch` and the email of the last committer's `email` as parameters to the build job.\r\n\r\n#### Manual triggers on branch commit\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Django admin and Add a Branch Job Trigger.  Select the branch and select the job you want any commits to the branch to trigger.  So long as active is checked, any commits to the branch should trigger the job.\r\n\r\n#### Automatic triggers on branch creation\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is helpful to create new job triggers against newly created branches using a prefix.  The CumulusCI process uses this for the Cumulus_feature, Cumulus_uat, and Cumulus_rel builds.\r\n\r\nThe system treats tags as branches just with different refs.  `refs/heads/*` refers to branches while `refs/tags/*` refers to tags.  This allows for creation of new Branch Job Triggers on creation of either a branch or a tag.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Cumulus_feature job should be triggered by any commit to a branch whose ref starts with `refs/heads/feature`.  To make the process easier for a developer, a Repository New Branch Job is created to automatically build a Branch Job Trigger on any feature branches to trigger the Cumulus_feature job.\r\n\r\nThe Cumulus_uat job triggers on creation of a new tag.  It's Repository New Branch Job prefix is `refs/tags/uat` and it triggers the Cumulus_uat job.\r\n\r\nIf no prefix is provided, all new branches or tags will have a Branch Job Trigger built for the specified job.\r\n\r\n## Handling Force.com Managed Package Versions\r\n\r\nmrbelvedere was built for use in [Project Cumulus](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/Cumulus) by the [Salesforce.com Foundation](http://www.salesforcefoundation.org).  We encountered a use case that was easiest solved by adding the functionality to the mrbelvedere application we were already using as part of our CI process.\r\n\r\nUse Case: I want to fetch the current version number and corresponding repository tag for beta and production managed package releases.  We use GitHub's Releases section to publish releases.  However, a release must be tagged, then deployed to a packaging org, then published before it is available to install.  We don't want a Release's version to be published until it is available for install.  Once the managed package is available, we already paste the install url into the body of the Release on GitHub so it made sense to look for the latest Release with an install_url in the body for beta and production releases (beta = prerelease in GitHub).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nhttp://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/mrbelvedere/repo/REPO_NAME/version\r\nhttp://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/mrbelvedere/repo/REPO_NAME/version/tag\r\n\r\nhttp://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/mrbelvedere/repo/REPO_NAME/version/beta\r\nhttp://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/mrbelvedere/repo/REPO_NAME/version/beta/tag\r\n\r\nThese links return either the version number (1.1 for production, 1.1 (Beta 3) for beta) or tag (rel/1.1 for production, uat/1.1-beta3 for beta).  The urls are called by both Jenkins and the Cumulus project's [build.xml](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/Cumulus/blob/master/build.xml) file to determine the most recent managed package.\r\n\r\nIf you use the Managed Package Version functionality on a repository, you will likely want to add GitHub authentication information (username & personal access token) on the Repository object in the Django admin.  This will cause the system to use authenticate calls to the GitHub API which helps avoid errors due to GitHub API limiting.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
