    <p>This application is built to assist you in contributing to a Salesforce package development project.  It is designed to require no prior knowledge of Git, GitHub, Ant, or Salesforce package development.  No local software is required to be installed on your computer.  All you need to get started is a GitHub account and a Salesforce Developer Edition org where you will develop your contribution.  Your contribution can be developed any way you like in your Developer Edition org including through the web customization, Developer Console, Force IDE, MavensMate, or any other method for customizing Salesforce metadata.</p>

    <p>The following tasks will be automatically handled for you:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a new GitHub Issue or selecting an existing one</li>
      <li>Creating a fork of the GitHub repository for the project</li>
      <li>Naming and creating a feature branch in your forked repository to hold your contribution</li>
      <li>Deploying from your feature branch to your Developer Edition org</li>
      <li>Retrieving your changes from your Developer Edition org and committing them to your feature branch</li>
      <li>Submitting a Pull Request in GitHub to submit your contribution for review and inclusion in the package</li>
    </ul>
